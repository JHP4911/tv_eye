TV Eye is a simple wrapper around YouTube videos

A typical video page on youtube.com is cluttered with description, comments and related videos

They get in the way of just watching the video and can sometimes spoil the whole
experience.

TV Eye takes a YouTube video id and uses it to embed the target video in a simple
web page with a plain grey background. In doing so it eliminates all the clutter
of the youtube.com site.

You can send a link to a friend so they can view the TV Eye wrapped version directly.
